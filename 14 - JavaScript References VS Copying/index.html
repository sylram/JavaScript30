    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    // however what happens when we update that array? now here is the problem!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    team[3] = 'test';
    console.log(players, team);

    //slice will copy the array or string // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team2 = players.slice(); 
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const playersCopy = [...players];
    playersCopy[2] = 'playerx'
    const playersCopy2 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(players, team, team2, playersCopy);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const personCopy = person;
    personCopy.name = 'newName';

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    //But there is an issue with this method. The issue is that you can lose your data. How?
    //JSON.stringify() works very well with primitive data types like numbers, strings, or Booleans, and that is what you have seen in our previous examples. 
    //But sometimes, JSON.stringify() is unpredictable if you are not aware of some values and how it handles them.
    //For example, it does not work with functions, symbols, or undefined values. It also changes other values like Nan and Infinity to null, breaking your code. 
    //When you have a function, symbol, or undefined value, it will return an empty key-value pair and skip it.
    const userDetails = {
      name: "John Doe",
      age: 14,
      status: {
        verified: false,
        method: Symbol(),
        title: undefined
      }
    };

  // Cloning the Object with Spread Operator
  let cloneUser = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(userDetails));
  console.log(cloneUser);

    name: "John Doe",
